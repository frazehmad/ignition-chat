## Description

### Connect with your Customers!

It's so important to connect with your international customers and understand their needs and make them feel good about your products and brand, but language can often be a barrier. Ignition Chat helps you eliminate that barrier.

### Increase Sales!

Ignition Chat helps you close more sales as you will be able to communicate effectively with your customers in the language they can understand.

### Reduce Costs!

Instead of hiring live support personnel for each of your target nationality, Ignition Chat helps you reduce costs by translating the customers for you.
